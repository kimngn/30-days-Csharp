Static class: the idea is you  put the data in and it will stay forever and everyone has access to that data. For stateless processsing

Instantiated classes store data.

Encapsulation:

make sure that sensitive data is hidden from users. To achieve this you must:
1. Declare fields/variables as private
2. provide public get and set methods, through properties, to access and update the value of private field

What is property ?
Property types:
Auto property: Hold normal class data. Allow us to expand get set, to allow more information, protecting information.

control your get set method
example: 

private string _ssn;   //private field
public string SSN
{
    get
    {
        string output = "****-**-" + _ssn.Substring(_ssn.Length - 5);
        return output;
    }
    
    set { _ssn = value;}


}
